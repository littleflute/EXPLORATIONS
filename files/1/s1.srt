4
00:00:19,996 --> 00:00:25,825
Today we tell about one of the world's greatest scientists, Isaac Newton.

5
00:00:26,024 --> 00:00:31,302
[Music]...

6
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:42,995
Much of today's science of physics is based on Newton's discovery of the three laws of motion and his theory of gravity. 

7
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:54,056
Newton also developed one of the most powerful tools of mathematics. It is the method we call calculus.

8
00:00:54,256 --> 00:01:08,027
Late in his life, Newton said of his work: "If I saw further than other men, it was because I stood on the shoulders of giants. "

9
00:01:08,227 --> 00:01:19,115
One of those giants was the great Italian scientist, Galileo. Galileo died the same year Newton was born. 

10
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:30,069
Another of the giants was the Polish scientist Nicholas Copernicus. He lived a hundred years before Newton.

11
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:47,903
Copernicus had begun a scientific revolution. It led to a completely new understanding of how the universe worked.<br> Galileo continued and expanded the work of Copernicus.<br>

12
00:01:48,102 --> 00:02:04,322
Isaac Newton built on the ideas of these two scientists and others. He found and proved the answers for which they searched.<br><br>(MUSIC)

13
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:15,959
Isaac Newton was born in Woolsthorpe, England, on December twenty-fifth, sixteen forty-two.

14
00:02:16,258 --> 00:02:38,401
He was born early. He was a small baby and very weak. No one expected him to survive. But he surprised everyone. <br>He had one of the most powerful minds in history. And he lived until he was eighty-four.

15
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:50,118
Newton's father died before he was born. His mother married again a few years later. She left Isaac with his grandmother.

16
00:02:50,317 --> 00:03:01,201
<br>The boy was not a good student. Yet he liked to make things, such as kites and clocks and simple machines.

17
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:17,225
Newton also enjoyed finding new ways to answer questions or solve problems. <br>As a boy, for example, he decided to find a way to measure the speed of the wind.

18
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:40,093
On a windy day, he measured how far he could jump with the wind at his back. <br>Then he measured how far he could jump with the wind in his face. <br>From the difference between the two jumps, he made his own measure of the strength of the wind.

19
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:52,872
<br>Strangely, Newton became a much better student after a boy kicked him in the stomach.<br>The boy was one of the best students in the school. <br>

20
00:03:53,151 --> 00:04:06,679
<br>Newton decided to get even by getting higher marks than the boy who kicked him. In a short time, Newton became the top student at the school.

21
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:10,849
Newton left school to help on the family farm.

22
00:04:11,048 --> 00:04:33,223
<br>It soon became clear, however, that the boy was not a good farmer. <br>He spent his time solving mathematical problems, instead of taking care of the crops. <br>He spent hours visiting a bookstore in town, instead of selling his vegetables in the market.

23
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:59,508
<br>An uncle decided that Newton would do better as a student than as a farmer. <br>So he helped the young man enter Cambridge University to study mathematics.<br>Newton completed his university studies five years later, in sixteen sixty-five. He was twenty-two years old.

24
00:04:59,619 --> 00:05:07,348
(MUSIC)

25
00:05:07,548 --> 00:05:29,554
At that time, a deadly plague was spreading across England. <br>To escape the disease, Newton returned to the family farm. He did more thinking than farming. <br>In doing so, he found the answers to some of the greatest mysteries of science.

26
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:55,177
Newton used his great skill in mathematics to form a better understanding of the world and the universe.<br>He used methods he had learned as a boy in making things. He experimented. <br>Then he studied the results and used what he had learned to design new experiments.

27
00:05:55,286 --> 00:06:19,715
<br>Newton's work led him to create a new method in mathematics for measuring areas curved in shape.<br>He also used it to find how much material was contained in solid objects. The method he created became known as integral calculus.

28
00:06:20,053 --> 00:06:50,101
One day, sitting in the garden, Newton watched an apple fall from a tree. He began to wonder if the same force that pulled the apple down also kept the moon circling the Earth. Newton believed it was. And he believed it could be measured. <br><br>He called the force "gravity." He began to examine it carefully.

29
00:06:50,242 --> 00:07:12,303
He decided that the strength of the force keeping a planet in orbit around the sun depended on two things. <br>One was the amount of mass in the planet and the sun. The other was how far apart they were.

30
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:40,001
Newton was able to find the exact relationship between distance and gravity. <br>He multiplied the mass of one space object by the mass of the other. <br>Then he divided that number by the square of their distance apart. The result was the strength of the gravity force that tied them to each other.

31
00:07:40,151 --> 00:08:10,161
Newton proved his idea by measuring how much gravity force would be needed to keep the moon orbiting the Earth. <br>Then he measured the mass of the Earth and the moon, and the distance between them. <br>He found that his measurement of the gravity force produced was not the same as the force needed. But the numbers were close.

32
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:29,700
Newton did not tell anyone about his discovery. He put it aside to work on other ideas. <br>Later, with correct measurements of the size of the Earth, he found that the numbers were exactly the same.

33
00:08:29,831 --> 00:09:20,155
Newton spent time studying light and colors. He used a three-sided piece of glass called a prism.<br><br>He sent a beam of sunlight through the prism. It fell on a white surface. The prism separated the beam of sunlight into the colors of a rainbow. Newton believed that all these colors -- mixed together in light -- produced the color white. He proved this by letting the beam of rainbow-colored light pass through another prism. This changed the colored light back to white light.<br>

34
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:48,829
 Newton's study of light led him to learn why faraway objects seen through a telescope do not seem sharp and clear. The curved glass lenses at each end of the telescope acted like prisms. They produced a circle of colored light around an object. This created an unclear picture.<br> <br>

35
00:09:49,374 --> 00:10:20,045
A few years later, Newton built a different kind of telescope. It used a curved mirror to make faraway objects seem larger.<br><br>Light reflected from the surface of the mirror, instead of passing through a curved glass lens. Newton's reflecting telescope produced much clearer pictures than the old kind of telescope.

37
00:10:26,322 --> 00:10:41,897
Years later, the British astronomer Edmund Halley visited Newton. He said he wanted Newton's help in finding an answer to a problem no one had been able to solve.

38
00:10:42,506 --> 00:10:58,483
 The question was this: What is the path of a planet going around the sun?<br><br>Newton immediately gave Halley the answer: an egg-shaped path called an ellipse.

39
00:10:58,663 --> 00:11:12,447
Halley was surprised. He asked for Newton's proof. Newton no longer had the papers from his earlier work. He was able to recreate them, however. 

40
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:20,365
He showed them to Halley. He also showed Halley all his other scientific work.<br>

41
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:32,607
Halley said Newton's scientific discoveries were the greatest ever made. He urged Newton to share them with the world.

42
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:42,889
Newton began to write a book that explained what he had done. It was published in sixteen eighty-seven.

43
00:11:43,088 --> 00:11:57,067
 Newton called his book “The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy.” The book is considered the greatest scientific work ever written.<br>

44
00:11:57,147 --> 00:12:10,456
In his book, Newton explains the three natural laws of motion. The first law is that an object not moving remains still.

45
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:22,692
 And one that is moving continues to move at an unchanging speed, so long as no outside force influences it.<br><br>

46
00:12:23,036 --> 00:12:31,657
Objects in space continue to move, because nothing exists in space to stop them.

47
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:48,726
Newton's second law of motion describes force. It says force equals the mass of an object, multiplied by the change in speed it produces in an object.<br>

48
00:12:48,997 --> 00:12:57,746
<br>His third law says that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

49
00:12:57,946 --> 00:13:15,305
 From these three laws, Newton was able to show how the universe worked. He proved it with easily understood mathematics. Scientists everywhere accepted Newton's ideas.<br>

50
00:13:15,454 --> 00:13:23,802
<br>The leading English poet of Newton's time, Alexander Pope, honored the scientist with these words: 

51
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:35,579
"Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night. God said, --'Let Newton be!' - and all was light. "<br>
